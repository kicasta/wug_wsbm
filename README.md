# WUG WSBM

The code in this repository comprises a lot of experiments (some finished, some not; some sucessful, some less so) with Weighted Stochastic Block Models applied to Word Usage Graphs. In this work you can find community detection applied to the wugs as well as different node and edge sampling; and a lot of other cool stuffs in this regard.
